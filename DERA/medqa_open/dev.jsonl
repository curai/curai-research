{"question": "A 6-week-old boy is brought to see his pediatrician. His mother says that he has not been feeding well and forcefully vomited after every feed over the past 4 days. The infant was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones.

{"question": "A 64-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of low back pain. He was diagnosed with benign prostatic hypertrophy several years ago, which worsened last year. A hard nodule was felt on a digital rectal exam, which led to a prostate biopsy that revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma. A bone scan at that time showed small, focal abnormalities in the lumbar spine. He subsequently underwent radiation therapy to his prostate and pelvic lymph nodes. He was then placed on leuprolide and an anti-androgen. He was doing well until 2 months ago when he developed low back pain, which has worsened since then. He reports that the pain is 8/10 and nearly constant. He states that the pain not only affects his ability to fall asleep but also wakes him up at night. The pain is mildly alleviated by ibuprofen. In addition to prostate cancer, his medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recurrent nephrolithiasis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. He takes aspirin, lisinopril, rosuvastatin, and pantoprazole. Upon physical examination, there is midline tenderness within the lumbar region.

Five days later, doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremities revealed extension of the clot in the right lower extremity to include the common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, tibial, and saphenous veins. In addition, a thrombus was noted in the left common femoral vein as well. CBC showed a decrease in platelet count from 195,000/uL on admission to 83,000/uL.

{"question": "A research group from Europe is investigating a potential link between certain lifestyle risk factors and the development of potentially fatal renal disease. They designed a cohort study that included 68 individuals: 34 exposed and 34 unexposed to given risk factors, who were followed up for 4 years in total. During this time, the renal disease of interest was seen in 6 individuals among the exposed group and 6 individuals among the unexposed group; thus, the risk ratio (RR) of the disease development (exposed vs. unexposed) was 1. During the initial 2 years, there was 1 death in the exposed group, and another death in the unexposed group. A survey administered for the last 2 years of the study showed that the prevalence ratio of disease between exposed and unexposed individuals was in fact 0.5 (at 2 years of follow-up there was only 1 case of the disease in the 34 exposed individuals, with a resulting prevalence of 2.94%; and only 2 cases of the disease in the 34 unexposed individuals, with a resulting prevalence of 5.88%), a value that deviates from the true RR (i.e. 1).

{"question": "A 52-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of blood in his urine. He had a mild respiratory illness 3 weeks ago. Urinalysis reveals a high red blood cell count and casts in the urine. A diagnosis of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is made. The physician explains that the treatment is supportive and that the patient needs to follow up with him every two weeks. Six weeks later, the patient returns to the clinic because he does not feel well; he has been experiencing malaise and fatigue. On examination, his pulse is 98/min, blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, temperature is 36.6°C (98.0°F), and respiratory rate is 16/min. He has a mildly distended abdomen. Blood tests reveal that the patient’s creatinine level has increased from 1.2 mg/dL to 3.0 mg/dL over the last month. He is referred to a nephrologist who diagnoses him with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and starts him on hemodialysis, as his potassium level has risen to 7 mEq/dL. The patient is advised to undergo renal transplantation. His human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype is A7/A5, B2/B9, C8/C3.

{"question": "A 37-year-old G1P1001 delivers a male infant at 9 pounds 6 ounces after a C-section for preeclampsia with severe features. The mother has a history of type II diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c of 12.8% at her first obstetric visit. Before this pregnancy, she was taking metformin, and during this pregnancy, she was started on insulin. At her routine visits, her glucose logs frequently showed fasting fingerstick glucoses above 120 mg/dL and postprandial values above 180 mg/dL. In addition, her routine third trimester culture for group B Streptococcus was positive. At 38 weeks and 4 days gestation, she was found to have a blood pressure of 176/103 mmHg and reported a severe headache during a routine obstetric visit. She denied rupture of membranes or vaginal bleeding. Her physician sent her to the obstetric triage unit, and after failure of several intravenous doses of labetalol to lower her blood pressure and relieve her headache, a C-section was performed without complication. Fetal heart rate tracing had been reassuring throughout her admission. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were 7 and 10. After one hour, the infant is found to be jittery; the infant's temperature is 96.1°F (35.6°C), blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 60/min.
