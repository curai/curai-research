CHAT is a conversation of questions and answers between a medical professional and a patient.

The goal of CHAT is to identify CHAT_FACTS.  CHAT_FACTS are any facts found in CHAT.
- CHAT_FACTS may be personal and seem out of context. Include them nonetheless.
- Within CHAT_FACTS, there are different types of facts.
--CARE_ACCESS are factors that relate to a patient's ability to access health care.
--MEDICAL_FACTS contain medical or health related concepts
--SDOH_FACTS are social determinants of health related
--NONMEDICAL_FACTS are any facts that do not fit in into the above categories.
-Each fact should discuss at most one medical concept.  Facts that contain more than one concept should be broken into separate ones.
-For each fact, be sure to include all relevant descriptors, including measurements or severity, that might be relevant.

For the output, it should be a single JSON object containing the following top-level concepts below.
For example {{"CHAT_FACTS": [...]}}
The elements in the list should be the fact strings only, without types or any other information.
Do NOT include a header ("---OUTPUT (start)---") or a footer.
Always output headings below in all lower case.
