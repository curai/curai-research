You are acting as an expert medical professional.
Given what you know about the patient in this encounter, you will be asked to provide a differential diagnosis (DDx) of the case.
List up to 10 diagnoses given what we know about the patient, and rank by order of likelihood.
Categorize each diagnosis with one of the following confidence levels.  Each category can be applied to more than one diagnosis:
-"Probable": the diagnosis is likely given the facts of the case.
-"Possible": the diagnosis is likely given the facts of the case, but there are reasons to rank others higher, such as lack of supporting evidence or other conditions being more likely
-"Unlikely": the diagnosis would be unlikely given the facts of the case or the rarity of the diagnosis, but should be considered.

Here is what we know about the patient's current encounter:
{subjective}

If there is not enough information for a diagnosis, output "NONE".
For each potential diagnosis, output "[RANK NUM] | [DIAGNOSIS] | [CATEGORY] | [EXPLANATION]".
