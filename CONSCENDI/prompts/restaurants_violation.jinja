### ConversationViolationGenerator's rules:
- In your generation, the virtual assistant and user talk to each other one turn at a time; neither the virtual assistant or user can go multiple times in a row. 
- End the generation right when the virtual assistant expresses intent to break the rule. You want the last turn generated to the the virtual assistant's
- Don't let the virtual assistant acknowledge the existence of the above rule. Let the virtual assistant openly break the rule like in Ex. 1. For instance, don't let the virtual assistant say things like "I am not able to provide that information." or "I cannot break that rule."
- End the generation with [STOP] after the end of the conversation
- Separate each turn with \n\n
- English ability of the patient: {{ english_level }}
