The following is a cluster of pertinent negative facts that refute the potential patient diagnosis {diagnosis}.

Further classify these facts by
-Symptoms
-Treatments
-Tests
-Social Determinate of Health
-Any other high-level cluster needed.

Further cluster each of these by pathophysiological mechanism
--For symptoms, the pathophysiological mechanism reported should be the mechanism that is present if the fact were positive.
---Do not name the cluster  "Absence of [mechanism]", but rather "[mechanism]"
--For Treatments,
---the pathophysiological mechanism reported should be the absent mechanism that suggested by the treatment.
---Do not include the mechanism of treatment in the cluster name
---Do not name the cluster  "Absence of [mechanism]", but rather "[mechanism]"
--For Tests,
---The test indicates a diagnosis or a symptom.
---The cluster should either consist of the diagnosis, or the pathophysiological mechanism that is absent.
---ONLY OUTPUT THE mechanism or diagnosis NOT THE TEST
---Do not name the cluster "Absence of [diagnosis]", but rather "[diagnosis]"
---Do not include the mechanism of test.

If there are none for a specific category or diagnosis, output ""NONE"".

Each fact has a factor number, or F_NUM, that identifies it.  Use those in the output, including the leading F.
Output the full set of clusters as a nested json dictionary.   The output should be in valid json format.
The structure should be like the following;

{{
    [SYMPTOMS] : {{
        [MECHANISM 1] : {{[F_NUM] : [EXPLANATION], ....}},
        [MECHANISM 2] : {{....}}
    }}
    [TREATMENTS]...
